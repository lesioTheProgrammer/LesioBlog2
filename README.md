The project has been made using Entitiy Framework with Code First approach. Database tables, generated by source code can be both accesed through application or directly through SQL Server.

MVC is the main design pattern used in this project. The View has been created on Razor pages, written in html files of this project, Model is the main component used in this project to generate database tables using Code First, it also supports every action made between UI and Database with LINQ. Controller is a glue, which is used to connect UI with buisness logic of the application, hidden in the Model.

In this project there's no straight distinction between Controller and Model in terms of buissness logic because many of actions are made directly in the Controller or Model, depending on the situation. 

Project also uses Dependency Injection, here: Ninject to make an extra layer between repository (model) and Controller, which has only access to the interfaces of the repository classes.
